# CLA_4bit_adder
This repository hosts a Verilog RTL design of a 4-bit carry-lookahead adder (CLA), optimized for high-performance binary arithmetic. The design uses 'Generate' and 'Propagate' logic for efficient carry computation, enabling parallel operations. Suitable for educational, research, and development activities
